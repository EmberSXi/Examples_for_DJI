# These simulation files are for DJI's HR team.
# The simulation is taken under taking-off at 4m/s condition with rotor speed of 500 rads/s. The structure is a simplified fixed-wing multi-rotor UAV.

# File T4_500_rotors_undamped.gif, T4_500_wing_1_undamped, and T4_500_wing_2_undamped show the two-way coupled structure response.
# File T4_500_vel_XY.gif shows the aerodynamic response at a XY plane, which is going through the centre of the pylon.
